Software-Assisted Vulnerability AssessmeNT (SAVANT) Tools for Climate Change in Coastal Communities

Description
The Integrated Coastal Sensitivity, Exposure, Adaptive Capacity for Climate Change (“I-see-sea-change”) Assessment Tool 
was the last to be developed from the Resilient Seas Program. ICSEACC integrates biodiversity concerns with elements of 
the VA for coastal integrity and the VA for fisheries into a more participatory tool designed to allow local governments 
to undertake synoptic vulnerability assessments for coastal areas for purposes of planning, prioritization of areas, and 
assessment of effectiveness of coastal management.

The usual process when using the ICSEACC Tool, is its respondents were asked to manually answer the survey on paper and 
ask to plot the values on excel sheet to generate the vulnerability scores. The project seeks to improve and expand the 
process and to facilitate its greater application to coastal communities in the Philippines by creating a mobile application 
to allow for intuitive visual guides to scoring and automated summarization and computation of resultant scores. This is to 
meet the need for a participatory vulnerability assessment tool that remains accurate and technically rigorous even when 
applied by non-specialists.
